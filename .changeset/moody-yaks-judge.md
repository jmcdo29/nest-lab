Adds platform-uws for uWebSockets.js HTTP/WSS Server

- `UWS` has a much [lower memory footprint](https://socket.io/docs/v4/memory-usage/)
- **socket.io** reintroduced `UWS` in [v4](https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-installation/#usage-with-uwebsockets) (it's back again!)
- Performance is allegedly ["8x that of fastify and at least 10x that of socket.io"](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js#zap-simple-performance)
